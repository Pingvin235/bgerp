= Development Workflow
:toc:

[[git-lab-git-hub]]
== GitLab and GitHub
All the development process is happening inside *GitLab* server https://git.bgerp.org
There we do branches for perform <<change, changes>>, run automatic <<test, tests>> and publish <<gitlab-ci, updates>>.

To the external *GitHub* https://github.com/Pingvin235/bgerp are <<publish-source, published>> only state of *master* branch after change's <<accept, acceptance>>.
The repository is enough for exploration purposes and <<../kernel/extension.adoc#custom, Custom>> development.

[[change]]
== Changes
Each *change* is performed in a separated GIT branch.
For development of the project we use link:https://docs.google.com/document/d/15NptRsx1qrdiWEew23EFz6gbxD6S12VQpnBQ6X9NbiQ/edit?usp=sharing[Standard GIT Workflow].
Similar one is used, for example, for GNU/Linux development.

The main idea is that merging is only happening 'downstream', i.e. from the main branch to secondary branches, in order to get to the actual state.
Main branch has linear structure as all changes are incorporated via 'patches'.
Secondary branches can be then deleted, as all the aggregated information from secondary branches will be present in the main branch.

drawio:_res/workflow_change.drawio[]

*master* is a main project branch and is used for <<build, builds>>.
[square]
* Each change should be related to a BGERP process with *PROCESS_ID*, used for all information exchange for a given change.
* For each change <<change-git-create, create>> a separate GIT branch based on master. Branch's name should start from *p<PROCESS_ID>*, then use "-" as delimiters.
Example: *p11788-link-filter-title*
* When developing, you can use any commit strategy within a branch: intermediate commits, reverts and resets.
We would recommend to <<change-git-commit, push>> intermediate commits, using GIT repository as a backup copy.
* Main branch can be periodically <<change-git-update, merged>> to the change branch in order to synchronize with the actual state.
* Branch has to add *build/change.<PROCESS_ID>.txt* file, create it by running `./gradlew touchChanges`. [[changes-file]]
This file has to describe new functions, fixes or other changes - each item on a separate row.
Format is identical to *changes.txt*, which accumulates all *build/change.<PROCESS_ID>.txt* information when <<build-release, release update>> gets published.
* All the necessary <<doc, documentation>> changes are done in the branch after the code changes.
* Request branch <<accept, acceptance>> to master once development and testing completes for a given change by moving BGERP process into *Acceptance* status.
* Process gets closed after check/acceptance, and change gets merged to master as a single commit with a comment starting with the change ID.

[[change-git]]
=== GIT Commands
IMPORTANT: Be sure that your local GIT repo is properly <<index.adoc#checkout-contrib, configured>>.

All the following GIT commands have to be executed in the project's directory.

[[change-git-create]]
==== Creation a change branch
[source]
----
git checkout master && git pull origin master && git checkout -b p12345-my-change-branch
----

[[change-git-commit]]
==== Commit and push changes
[source]
----
git checkout p12345-my-change-branch && git add . && git commit -am "My changes" && git push
----

At the first push for a branch you will be asked to set an upstream branch using the command.
[source]
----
git push --set-upstream origin p12345-my-change-branch
----

[[change-git-state]]
==== Show current workdirs' state
For showing the current state of GIT working directory use:
[source]
----
git status
----

Displays text-rendered GIT graph:
[source]
----
git log --oneline --decorate --all --graph
----

[[change-git-update]]
==== Update a change branch
[source]
----
git checkout p12345-my-change-branch && git pull --rebase && git fetch origin master:master && git merge master
----

[[change-git-cleanup]]
==== Cleanup
Clean all links to non-existent/deleted branches.
[source]
----
git remote prune origin
----

Clean GIT repo from unreferenced objects after.
[source]
----
git reflog expire --expire-unreachable=now --all &&
git gc --prune=now
----

Clean unneeded link:https://git-lfs.github.com/[GIT LFS] files.
[source]
----
git lfs prune
----

[[change-git-trouble]]
==== Troubleshooting
Error: *Encountered 7 file(s) that should have been pointers, but weren't*
link:https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46704572/git-error-encountered-7-files-that-should-have-been-pointers-but-werent/54221959[Solution]

Probably only these two commands are enough:
[source]
----
git rm .gitattributes
git reset .
----

[[accept]]
=== Acceptance
When change is being accepted, 'change' branch is compared with the master.
So merge the latest state of master to the 'change' branch before passing a change to acceptance.

image::_res/branch_compare.png[]

GIT commands to be used for merging change from *pXXXXX-short-change-description* branch to master:
[source, bash]
----
git checkout pXXXXX-short-change-description && git pull
git commit --allow-empty -m "MERGED" && git push
git checkout master && git pull
git merge --squash pXXXXX-short-change-description
----

Commit with current GIT user.
[source, bash]
----
git commit -am "pXXXXX Some change description."
----

Or for preserving the author in GitHub. Mapping internal to external mails is available in file `.gitlab-ci-publish-author.sh`
[source, bash]
----
git commit -am "pXXXXX Some change description." --author="Developer Name <internal@gitlab.email>"
----

And finally, push.
[source, bash]
----
git push
----

IMPORTANT: Perform a separate GIT Push after each <<accept, acceptance>> in order to correctly <<publish-source, publish>> in the open repository.

<<build-release, Release is published>> periodically from the *master* branch.

[[long-lived-branch]]
=== Long-lived branches
Long-lived branches only get changes which *are not altering product functionality*, for example: localization and documentation fixes, code formatting, tests.
BGERP process for a change does not get closed , and <<accept, acceptance>> is performed multiple times upon completion of specific change(s).

[[doc]]
=== Documentation
For building of the manual used Open Source tool link:https://pzdcdoc.org[PzdcDoc].
The source AsciiDoctor and resource files are placed in `srcx/doc` directory.
The examples of documentation's format may be found <<examples.adoc#doc, here>>.

[[doc-plugin]]
==== Plugin
<<index.adoc#plugin, Plugin>> documentation should have the following structure:
[square]
* *About* - common information about;
* *Setup* - how to configure;
* *Usage* - using instructions with screenshots;
* *Development* - recommendation for developers.

As examples of following the structure see plugins: <<../plugin/git/index.adoc#, GIT>>, <<../plugin/svc/backup/index.adoc#, Backup>>.

[[doc-image]]
==== Images
Images like screenshots in documentation *must* be stored in PNG format with *.png* extension.
This extension is configured to be stored in GIT LFS.
Use *width* attribute for limiting size rather than resizing that can sometimes increase a file size.

[[doc-change]]
==== Change
Documentation changes are recommended to be done at the end of <<change, branch development>>, using <<changes-file, changes file>> as preliminary notes.
CI job <<test-and-publish-update, test-and-publish-update>> builds documentation automatically for each commit or it might be <<build-doc, built>> locally.

Due the strict references and snippets checking, it is quite possible to have broken <<test-and-publish-update, state>> of documentation
even without changes in `.adoc` files. Something like the following:
[source]
----
2020-05-25 12:17:39,149 INFO DocGenerator [main] Processing: srcx/doc/project.adoc
2020-05-25 12:17:39,844 ERROR Snippet [main] Snippet '../../src/ru/bgcrm/struts/action/MessageAction.java' doesn't start from: 'message.se', line number: 205, content: newProcess.setDescription(message.getSubject());

For such cases here is the *fixing algorithm*.
First, find the failing line in `.adoc` file:

image::_res/snippet_fix_1.png[]

After that, using branch comparison, find the new rows and change them in the `.adoc`:

image::_res/snippet_fix_2.png[]

Hints:
[square]
* If documentation was already corrected in the current branch, you can create a mock branch on the last working state.
* Use line numbers for searching over failing snippets.

Place human readable changes description with screens (possible link images from a main article) in <<../changes/00000/index.adoc#, 00000>> changes file.

[[doc-release]]
==== Release
Publication of the product manual <<publish-doc, runs>> automatically from <<long-lived-branch, long-lived branch>> *p11862-documentation*.
In the same branch may be made changes for *documentation only of the latest release* that also will be published.

[[gitlab-ci]]
== GitLab CI
link:../../../.gitlab-ci.yml[.gitlab-ci.yml] file has configuration for running certain jobs automatically upon each GIT commit.
Different jobs are executed within different <<change, GIT>> branches.

[[gitlab-ci-job]]
=== Jobs
Please find below description of CI jobs.

[[test-and-publish-update]]
==== test-and-publish-update
The job is executed in every <<change, change>> branch.

Launches <<unit-test, Unit tests>> and <<build-doc, documentation build and validity check>.
If everything is wents without error then publishing <<build-change, update>> with documentation from the branch to https://bgerp.org/update/<PROCESS_ID>

NOTE: All the published change updates have the same version, equal to the next release.

[[test-and-publish-update-master]]
==== test-and-publish-update-master
The job is executed in *master* branch.

Does the same as *test-and-publish-update* but for master branch.
As there is no real *PROCESS_ID* available, it is taken as *00000* <<build-change, published>> update.
The artificial change *00000* can be used for updating to the latest state of *master*.
To this state is periodically reset https://demo.bgerp.org instance.

[[test-integration]]
==== test-integration
The job is executed in *master* branch.

Runs <<integration-test, integration test>>.
Upon successful tests execution, written in DB dump gets extracted for https://demo.bgerp.org

[[publish-source]]
==== publish-source
The job is executed in *master* branch.

Publishes actual source code from `master` into an open repository https://github.com/pingvin235/bgerp
//This method has been chosen in order to limit an open repository size and in order to hide previously deleted files from history.

[[publish-doc]]
==== publish-doc
The job is executed in <<long-lived-branch, long-lived branch>> *p11862-documentation*.

The branch contains the documentation sources for the latest release.
Launches <<build-doc, documentation build and validity check>>, if no errors are found, publishes on https://bgerp.org/doc/3.0/manual.

[[gitlab-ci-runner]]
=== Runners
Runners are responsible for executing jobs. The project already has some runners available,
but you can register additional ones to speed up process.

The list of runners is available here: https://git.bgerp.org/admin/runners
There also can be taken registration *token*.

image::_res/gitlab_runner_token.png[width="800px"]

A runner can be also added are here: https://git.bgerp.org/bgerp/bgerp/-/settings/ci_cd under *Runners* section.

That can be done on every system with installed Docker.
[source]
----
# delete existing runner if exists
docker pull gitlab/gitlab-runner:latest && docker stop gitlab-runner && docker rm gitlab-runner
# create and start runner container
docker run -d --name gitlab-runner --restart always -v /srv/gitlab-runner/config:/etc/gitlab-runner -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock gitlab/gitlab-runner:latest
# register runner, use executor: 'docker', URL: https://git.bgerp.org/
docker run --rm -it -v /srv/gitlab-runner/config:/etc/gitlab-runner gitlab/gitlab-runner register
----

[[build]]
== Build and publish
Project is configured in Gradle format (configuration file: link:../../../build.gradle[build.gradle])

For building and publishing, apart from Java you will need <<index.adoc#env-console, console environment>> with available *ant*, *ssh* and *rsync* packages.

NOTE: Here and below all commands are shown for WSL environment, *NIX will not need `bash -c` prefix.

[[build-doc]]
=== Documentation
[source]
----
bash -c "./gradlew clean doc"
----
Resulting HTML files will be present in *target/doc*. Internal link validation is performed automatically.

[[build-change]]
=== Change
NOTE: This task is automatically run by <<test-and-publish-update, CI>>.

Build and publish on https://bgerp.org/update update package with a <<change, change>>.

All the updates packages are copies to Web directory: `https://bgerp.org/update/PROCESS_ID`
The <<changes-file, changes file>> has also copied, and all documentation links there starting from `https://bgerp.org/doc`
are automatically replaced to the `https://bgerp.org/update/PROCESS_ID/doc`.

Users have a capability to <<../kernel/install.adoc#installer-iface, update>> to the change using a *PROCESS_ID* as an identifier.

Multiple update publications are possible until all bugs/caveats are found - after that that change <<accept, accepted>>
into a main branch and a new build gets <<build-release, published>>

[[build-release]]
=== Release
[IMPORTANT]
====
Public SSH key or the developer might be added for *cdn@bgerp.org* and *www@bgerp.org*.
Before you publish a change update, make sure that `ssh cdn@bgerp.org` and `ssh www@bgerp.org` sessions work for you.

Script `files.sh` uses *rename* command, it must be installed.
====

Build is performed from a *master* branch and can include many <<accept, accepted changes>>.

CAUTION: Be sure that <<test-integration, Integration tests>> are successfully done on *master* to provide data for Demo DB.

Perform the following:
[source, bash]
----
bash -c "./gradlew resetProperties clean buildClean buildUpdateLib buildUpdate"
----

NOTE: `buildUpdateLib` task checks existence of file `build/changes.lib.txt`, marking changes in <<index.adoc#java-lib, Java libraries>>.

Build a <<build-docker, Docker Image>>:
[source, bash]
----
bash build/docker/files.sh && docker build build/docker -t bgerp/bgerp && docker push bgerp/bgerp
----

Then:
[source, bash]
----
bash -c "./gradlew patchChanges rss publishBuild publishCommit"
----

Check the release commit and make:
[source, bash]
----
git push
----

Pick documentation changes back to master.
[source, bash]
----
git checkout master && git pull --rebase && git merge --squash p11862-documentation && git commit -am "p11862 Documentation." && git push
----

Merge the latest state of the master on <<doc-release, documentation>> branch:
[source, bash]
----
git checkout p11862-documentation && git pull --rebase && git merge master && git push
----

Folder with current changes <<../changes/00000/index.adoc#, 00000>> has to be copied to a new one and changes cleaned up.

Add news to Web sites about release with a link to the release changes.

NOTE: In case of bugfix releases already existing changes document may be renamed, now news is needed.

[[build-docker]]
==== Docker Image
When pushing image from a system first you would need to perform login:
[source]
----
docker login --username bgerp
----

And input *access token*.

*bgerp/bgerp* image is based on *bgerp/base*, which should be rebuilt in case of updating MySQL or Java versions:
[source]
----
bash build/docker/base/files.sh && docker build build/docker/base -t bgerp/base && docker push bgerp/base
----

[[test]]
== Tests

[[unit-test]]
=== Unit
JUnit framework is used (`srcx/test` directory)
Used to test specific algorithms, test do not depend on each other and do not work with DB.

Test are launched locally using the following command:
[source, bash]
----
bash -c "./gradlew clean test"
----

[[integration-test]]
=== Integration
TestNG framework is used (`srcx/itest` directory)

Integration test performs initialization an empty DB and filling after it with configuration.
Tests form a dependencies graph which defined order and execution parallelism.

[source, bash]
----
./gradlew itest
----

By default the tests uses MySQL instance with credentials taken from `bgerp.properties` file.
For local run use <<index.adoc#run-data, Docker DB Instance>> for that.

[[integration-test-opt]]
==== Optimization
Additionally to the recommended MySQL <<../kernel/install.adoc#mysql, configuration>>, check and set in `my.ini`:
[source]
----
innodb_file_per_table=0
----

That will significantly increase table creation speed.
After the first successful run, the structure of a DB will remain persistent and re-created faster by this way.

Creation of dump for Windows:
[source, bash]
----
echo DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS bgerp; > ./dump.sql &&
echo CREATE DATABASE bgerp DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci; >> ./dump.sql &&
echo USE bgerp; >> ./dump.sql &&
mysqldump -uDB_USER -pDB_PSWD bgerp --add-drop-database --no-data >> ./dump.sql &&
type build\bgerp\db_init_end.sql >> ./dump.sql
----

For *NIX:
[source, bash]
----
echo "DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS bgerp;" > ./dump.sql &&
echo "CREATE DATABASE bgerp DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci;" >> ./dump.sql &&
echo "USE bgerp;" >> ./dump.sql &&
mysqldump -uDB_USER -pDB_PSWD bgerp --add-drop-database --no-data >> ./dump.sql &&
cat build/bgerp/db_init_end.sql >> ./dump.sql
----

Running the tests after:
[source, bash]
----
mysql -uDB_USER -pDB_PSWD < ./dump.sql &&
gradlew integrationTest -Pdb.user=DB_USER -Pdb.pswd=DB_PSWD -Pskip.dbReset=true
----

[[setup-process-type]]
=== Process Types

[[setup-process-type-product]]
==== Product
Represents information about product, available by subscription.
Has the following <<../../../kernel/setup.adoc#param, parameters>>:
[square]
* *Product ID* - unique *text* product identifier, used for <<#usage, license>> generation and <<#usage-price-calculator, calculation>> of price;
* *Price* - one ore more *listcount* prices, value IDs must be the same as in <<#setup-process-type-subscription, Limit>> parameter of subscription.

[[setup-process-type-subscription]]
==== Subscription
Contains information about customer's subscription, parameters:
[square]
* *Email* - *email* customer with the subscription's customer;
* *Subscription* - *list* with values equals to configured <<#setup-config-subscription, subscription's>> IDs;

[[setup-config]]
=== Configuration
Make sure the plugin is enabled in <<../../../kernel/setup.adoc#config, configuration>>.

Add in the plugin configuration the following block:
[source]
----
subscription:sign.key.file=<privateSshKeyPath>

# product process params
subscription:param.productId=<paramProductId>
# subscription process params
subscription:param.email=<paramEmailId>
subscription:param.subscription=<paramSubscriptionId>
subscription:param.limit=<paramLimitId>
subscription:param.cost.service=<paramServiceCostId>
subscription:param.cost.discount=<paramDiscountId>
subscription:param.cost=<paramCostId>
subscription:param.dateTo=<paramDateToId>
subscription:param.lic=<paramLicId>
# optional user params
#subscription:param.user.incoming.tax.percent=<paramIncomingTaxPercentId>
# optional keys
#subscription:max.dateTo.months=<maxDateToMonths>
----

Where:
[square]
* *<privateSshKeyPath>* - file path with private SSH key, used for signing license files, for example: */home/bitel/.ssh/id_rsa*, the public key has to be introduced in key using App;
* *<paramProductId>* - ID of <<#setup-process-type-product, Product ID>> parameter;
* *<paramEmailId>* - ID of <<#setup-process-type-subscription, Email>> parameter;
* *<paramSubscriptionId>* - ID of <<#setup-process-type-subscription, Subscription>> parameter;
* *<paramLimitId>* - ID of <<#setup-process-type-subscription, Limit>> parameter;
* *<paramServiceCostId>* - ID of <<#setup-process-type-subscription, Service Cost>> parameter;

* *<paramCostId>* - ID of <<#setup-process-type-subscription, Cost>> parameter;
* *<paramDateToId>* - ID of <<#setup-process-type-subscription, Date To>> parameter;
* *<paramLicId>* - ID of <<#setup-process-type-subscription, License>> parameter;
* *<paramIncomingTaxPercentId>* - ID of user parameter of type *text* with incoming payments tax, taken on account in <<usage-report, Payments Report>>;
* *<maxDateToMonths>* - how many months in future from the current one can be set *Date To* parameter value.

[[setup-config-subscription]]
==== Subscriptions
Add the following configuration block for each of supported subscriptions.
[source]
----
subscription:subscription.<id>.title=<title>
subscription:subscription.<id>.process.type=<processSubscriptionTypeId>
subscription:subscription.<id>.param.limit.price=<paramLimitPriceId>
----

Where:
[square]
* *<id>* - unique numeric subscription ID;
* *<title>* - subscription title;
* *<paramLimitPriceId>* - ID of <<#setup-process-type-product, Price>> parameter.

[[setup-config-subscription-paid-invoice]]
===== Paid Invoice Actions
The plugin supports several actions on paid <<../invoice/index.adoc#usage, invoices>> in a subscription process.
To activate them in a subscription configuration should be added the following keys.

[source]
----
subscription:subscription.<id>.paid.invoice.dateTo.expression=<dateToExpression>
# optionally
#subscription:subscription.<id>.paid.invoice.email.message.type=<emailMessageTypeId>
#subscription:subscription.<id>.paid.invoice.email.subject=<emailSubject>
#subscription:subscription.<id>.paid.invoice.email.text.expression=<emailTextExpression>
----

Where:
[square]
* *<dateToExpression>* - <<../../../kernel/extension.adoc#jexl, JEXL>> expression for calculating a new license *Date To* value, with additional context variables:
** *invoice* object of javadoc:org.bgerp.plugin.bil.invoice.model.Invoice[]
* *<emailMessageTypeId>* - <<../../msg/email/index.adoc#setup-message-type, message type ID>> of type Email which will be used for creation of a notification mail with a new license file, exact ID value may be replaced to *0* that will take the first message type of type Email from server configuration;
* *<emailSubject>* - the mail's subject;
* *<emailTextExpression>* - <<../../../kernel/extension.adoc#jexl, JEXL>> expression for generation the mail's content, with additional context variables:
** *invoice* object of javadoc:org.bgerp.plugin.bil.invoice.model.Invoice[]

Here a sample of subscription configuration taken from Demo.

[[setup-price-calculator]]
=== Price Calculator
The price calculator is implemented as an <<../../../kernel/iface.adoc#open-process-queue, open process queue>> with <<../../../kernel/process/queue.adoc#processor-open, processor>>.
The queue has to be assigned to <<#setup-process-type-product, Product>> process type, and have following processor in configuration:
[source]
----
processor.{@inc:cnt}.iface=open
processor.{@cnt}.page.url=/open/plugin/subscription/subscription.do
# optionally predefined subscription value
#processor.{@cnt}.subscription.value=<id>
----

Where:
[square]
* *<id>* - unique numeric subscription ID.

[[usage]]
== Usage

[[usage-product]]
=== Product

image::_res/process_product.png[width="800"]

*Product Owner* is a user, becoming <<#usage-report, profit>> from subscriptions, using his product, has to be assigned as an process <<../../../kernel/process/index.adoc#usage-card-executor, executor>> with *role=1*.

[[usage-subscription]]
=== Subscription
Each customer subscription is presented as a process with <<../../../kernel/process/index.adoc#usage-related-process, related>> Product processes with type *Depend*.

image::_res/subscription_process.png[width="800"]

An *Consultant* is a user, taking responsibility for the process and becoming <<#usage-report, profit>> in size of Service Cost parameter value.
The Consultant has to be assigned as a process <<../../../kernel/process/index.adoc#usage-card-executor, executor>> with *role=0*.

*Subscription Cost* parameter value is automatically recalculated on changing subscription, limit, related products, discount or service cost parameters.

After sending an invoice and paying that, *Date To* parameter has to be changed, that update *License File*.

image::_res/subscription_process_license_send.png[width="800"]

[[usage-report]]
=== Subscription Payments Report
The plugin provides *Subscription Payments* <<../../report/index.adoc#, Report>>, which shows how much money owns a report generating user to plugin owners.

image::_res/payment_report.png[width="800"]

User received amounts for a month are taken from paid invoices with payment date in the month, marked as paid by the current user.
Using the report each payment receiver can determinate parts of Consultants and Owners.

[[usage-price-calculator]]
=== Price Calculator
In open process queue customers can choose interesting subscription, products and limit and get subscription month price.

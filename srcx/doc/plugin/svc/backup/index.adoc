[[setup-remote-ssh]]
=== Setting up remote backup via SSH
All commands are executed by *root*.

// Said that, in order for all related file system operations to be successful, only SSH access to remote server is sufficient.
[[setup-remote-ssh-server]]
==== Backup Server
On a backup host has to be generated a SSH key pair for user *root*:
----
ssh-keygen -t ed25519
----

The public key of the pair must be allowed to access for a created user *backup*:
----
useradd backup
mkdir -m 700 /home/backup/.ssh
mkdir -m 600 /home/backup/.ssh/authorized_keys
cat /root/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub >> /home/backup/.ssh/authorized_keys
chown -R backup:backup /home/backup/.ssh
----

[[setup-remote-ssh-app]]
==== Application Server
Assuming we are configuring backup for a BGERP instance running on server *bgerp.org* to backup server *backup.bgerp.org*.

The previously mentioned private key *id_ed25519* for user *root@backup.bgerp.org* store to file `/root/.ssh/backup` on *bgerp.org*.
Create the directory if missing:
----
mkdir -m 700 /root/.ssh
----

In the same directory place a `config` file with the following content:
----
Host backup.bgerp.org
    HostName backup.bgerp.org
    IdentityFile /root/.ssh/backup
Host *
    StrictHostKeyChecking no
    UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null
----

Install package *sshfs*:
[source]
----
dnf install sshfs
----

Mount SSHFS using the command below:
[source]
----
sshfs -o allow_other backup@backup.bgerp.org:/home/backup/bgerp.org/opt/bgerp/backup /opt/bgerp/backup
----

* You can use drop-box to create backups with or without DB content.
* Outdated backups can be removed using a button in the top-left corner of table. Number of backups preserved by the system is configured via <<setup, configured>>.
* Buttons in right table column allow restoring from backups. The application is automatically restarted after this operation.

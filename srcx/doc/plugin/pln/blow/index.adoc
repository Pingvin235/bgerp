[[about]]
== About
The plugin allows to organize up-to-down planning for complex software and similar projects.
Unlike Kanban or SCRAM approaches, providing flat list of tasks, a Blow board visualizes task's hierarchy and their distribution over executors.
The main goal is providing very quick overview of the current project state with clear understanding what should be done next for each of team members.

NOTE: You can see an enabled plugin operation in <<../../../kernel/install.adoc#demo, Demo System>>.

[[setup]]
== Setup

[[setup-queue]]
=== Process Queue
Each board used as primary data list of processes from a <<../../../kernel/process/queue.adoc#, process queue>>.
About filtering and sorting the plugin takes care itself.
Depending on shown data for the queue have to be configured necessary columns, like for examples in the Demo:

[snippet, from="column.1", to=".yyyy"]
link:../../../../itest/org/bgerp/itest/plugin/pln/blow/BlowTest.process.queue.config.txt[Plugin Blow process queue config]

[[setup-board]]
=== Board
After enabling the plugin via <<../../../kernel/setup.adoc#config-plugin, server config>> add for any board the following configuration:

[source]
----
blow:board.<id>.title=<title>
blow:board.<id>.queueId=<queueId>
# optional parameters
blow:board.<id>.executor.groups=<groupIds>
blow:board.<id>.executor.roles=<roleIds>
blow:board.<id>.stringExpressionCell=<stringExpressionCell>
blow:board.<id>.openUrl=<openUrl>
----

Where:
[square]
* *<id>* - unique numeric board ID;
* *<queueId>* - primary data <<#setup-queue, process queue>> ID;
* *<groupIds>* - comma separated process execution groups IDs, by default all groups are taken;
* *<roleIds>* - comma separated process execution <<../../../kernel/process/index.adoc#usage-card-executor, roles>> IDs, by default only role *0* is taken;
* *<openUrl>* - board name for publishing on <<../../../kernel/interface.adoc#open, open interface>> with URL  *../open/blow/<openUrl>*.

*<stringExpression>* contains <<../../../kernel/extension.adoc#jexl, JEXL>> expression for evaluating of cell text.
In the expression context beside default variables and *process* are passed queue column values as variables *colX*, where *X* is a column ID.
If not defined in the board cells are shown process descriptions. Here is an example of such configuration, taken from Demo:

[snippet, from="blow:board.1.str", to="END"]
link:../../../../itest/org/bgerp/itest/plugin/pln/blow/BlowTest.config.txt#L4-L27[Plugin Blow board config]

A resulting cell looks like that for process with unread messages.

Or like that for a process with incident type.

[[setup-board-filter]]
=== Filters
Filters are buttons with script generated texts, placed over a board and matching some processes on the board.
Click on the buttons highlights matching processes with the filter's color and scrolls to the hightest of them.
Here are the filters from Demo:

image::_res/filters.png[]

And the implementing them configuration.

[[usage]]
== Usage
Blow plan is presented in a table form where columns are executors and processes
are shown in cells with <<#setup-board, generated text>> and opening link.
For displaying are taken only open processes without closing date.

[[usage-process-groups]]
=== Process Groups
Process hierarchy is based on <<../../../kernel/process/index.adoc#usage-related-process, relation type>> *Made*.
Note that all classical planning entities like tasks, projects, sub-projects are implemented only using
*parent* - *child* processes with only *two levels* of depth. On the screen below you can see two such process groups:
*56* parent with *57* and *58* children and *53* - *55* - *54*.

image::_res/board.png[width="800"]

Moving mouse over highlights the process group under cursor.
Using mouse drag-and-drop child processes can be moved to other groups.
On the screens below the *58* child process is being moved to *53* parent.

image::_res/move_58.png[width="800"]

After that the planning board has the following view.

image::_res/move_58_after.png[width="800"]

The same action can be performed used right-click popup menu with
items *Cut* and *Paste* there. That way is especially good for large boards.

image::_res/move_58_cut.png[width="800"]

Another possible operation after *Cut* would be *Merge*, allowing to concatenate all messages from a cut process to the target one.
It can be used for joining processes with same functionality, going to be done at once.

Independent processes are shown under fake *NO GROUP* parent and behave in general like all other groups.
Child processes can be moved from and to it using drag-and-drop or *Cut* - *Paste* menu items from right click popup menu.
There is also available separated *Make independent* item, allowing a quick way to make child processes independent, placed in *NO GROUP*.

The last still not described here right-click menu item is *Clone process*, it makes duplicate of a clicked process with same type, description,
but without messages.

[[usage-executors]]
=== Executors
Processes with no or many executers are shown for the full table width.
Such processes are meant as unassigned, if a parent process has at least one unassigned child process,
the parent is also treated like unassigned.

[[usage-ordering]]
=== Ordering
For process group sorting are used the following criteria, as an example you can use the previous screen:
[square]
* the more *priority* is higher: processes 60 - 56 - 59 / 53;
* *unassigned* is higher than assigned;
* further *status* is higher than earlier;
* *parent* process is higher than independent or child.

The idea behind the rules is showing the next doing processes on the board's top.

[[usage-messages]]
=== Messages
Unlike in other planning tools process is not the smallest unit of work that can be done.
You shouldn't create a new process for any wish or remark. Instead you may collect them in process messages.
Number of them is shown for the Demo board configuration, like *4* on the screen.

image::_res/messages_board_cnt.png[width="800"]

And here how do they look inside the process. As you can see, all *Blow UI* related thoughts just written down.

image::_res/messages_process.png[width="800"]

At the board have to be placed only processes which already described to be done at the observable time.
So, whenever the time is there, any message can be separated to a new process using *...* menu, like shown on the screen.

image::_res/message_to_made_copy.png[width="800"]

After changing of description the newly created process.

image::_res/message_to_made_copy_description.png[width="800"]

It is available on our board.

image::_res/message_to_made_copy_new.png[width="800"]

Using *Search* tool on the top of the board existing messages can be quickly checked on already written remarks.
The messages are found by simple substring match, in resulting drop-down are shown processes with count of matching messages in square braces.

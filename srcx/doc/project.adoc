BGERP is quite a large and complex project. It was created by a team consisting of ordinary humans, who may be imperfect and make
mistakes but try to learn continuously. This is a trial and error process, fortunately or not.

This article provides some recommendations collected during the learning process - these are accompanied by a very small amount of <<samples, code>>
for exactly the same reason. Said that, you have to follow those recommendations using *The Boy Scout Rule*.

IMPORTANT: Always leave the campground cleaner than you found it.

While changing a block of code, it is important to try to decrease the usage of outdated approaches, methods and classes.
Write a new code and keep it compliant with the latest recommendations, but at the same time try to get neighboring/adjacent code improved.
During <<workflow, changes>> testing, code improvements will be tested as well.
All in all, gradually, we will improve overall code quality.
We plan to introduce a set of formal code quality metrics: number of compiler warnings, format checks, etc.


[[lang]]
== Languages
The project currently undergoes a migration process from Russian language to an international one (English).
All the software documentation, including this article, and all log messages will be converted to English.
Information shown to the end-user via interface has to be <<l10n, localized>>.

[[project]]
== Project
[[env]]
=== Environment
The program can be developed on any Java-supported platform:
[square]
* Windows;
* Linux;
* MacOS.

Minimal required set of software:
[square]
* <<kernel/install.adoc#java, OpenJDK>>;
* Docker or <<kernel/install.adoc#mysql, MySQL Server>>.

[[env-console]]
==== Shell for Windows
NOTE: Skip this chapter when using *NIX OS.

Console link:https://git-scm.com/download/win[client] for version control system <<workflow, GIT>>.

System of <<build, build and publish>> is written on Bash scripts and uses GNU utilities, you can use the following when using Windows:
[square]
* link:https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/how-to-install-wsl2-on-windows-10[WSL 2] - embedded in Windows virtual Linux machine;
* link:https://www.cygwin.com/[Cygwin] - Windows ports of GNU utils, not tested.

The best console emulator on Windows with embedded FAR Manager - link:https://conemu.github.io/[ConEmu].

[[checkout]]
=== Checkout
Checkout the project using GIT to an wanted directory, e.g.: `bgerp`.

Configure GIT inside the directory. Use your name and email instead.
[source]
----
git config user.name "Shamil Vakhitov"
git config user.email shamil@bgerp.org
git config pull.rebase true
git config core.fileMode false
git config core.longpaths true
git config core.autocrlf false
----

[[run]]
=== Running

[[run-data]]
==== DB container
Use the Docker image for running developer DB instance.
Run the following command inside of the project's directory.

[source, bash]
----
docker pull bgerp/bgerp && docker run -p 3306:3306 --name bgerp-demo -d bgerp/bgerp
----

Make sure, that the container is running using the command:
[source, bash]
----
docker exec bgerp-demo /opt/bgerp/erp_status.sh
----

Get configuration and data files from the container:
[source, bash]
----
docker cp bgerp-demo:/opt/bgerp/bgerp.properties bgerp.properties
docker cp bgerp-demo:/opt/bgerp/log4j.properties log4j.properties
docker cp bgerp-demo:/opt/bgerp/filestorage filestorage
----

For <<db, DB update>> on each start at the end of `bgerp.properties` must be added <<kernel/setup.adoc#config-on-start, option>>:
[source]
----
runOnStart+=,ru.bgcrm.util.distr.DevDbUpdater
----

NOTE: Use the command for removing the created container:
[source, bash]
----
docker rm -f bgerp-demo
----

[[run-gradle]]
==== Command line
Execute command:
[source]
----
gradlew startServer
----

After correct start of the server, Web interface has to be available at URL: http://localhost:9088/user
Use *admin* - *admin* credentials.

[[run-launch]]
==== Inside IDE
Configuration for running inside IDE:
[square]
* Main class: ru.bgerp.Server
* Program arguments: start
* VM arguments: -Dbgerp.setup.data=bgerp
* Classpath: click on *User entries - Advanced - Add folders* and add project's current folder.

[[format]]
=== Code formatting
IDE or editor must be configured for displaying whitespace symbols.

image::_res/ide_format.png[width='600px']

The projects mostly follow recommended formatting rules for each of programming languages they use.
Intention:
[square]
* 4 whitespaces - Java;
* 2 whitespaces - SQL <<db, scripts>>;
* tabs - all the rest.

However because of historical reasons many files have been formatted in a wrong way, and have to be carefully fixed.
Screenshot above shows an example of a Java file still using tabs.

When working on fixing a file format, it is important to use the following rules:
[arabic]
. All new files should be formatted correctly.
. Avoid using both indent symbols (tabs and spaces) inside a single file! Such file becomes unreadable in certain editors. If you notice a file/case like this,
make sure to change all indent symbols in the file to the required format.
. Be cautious when combining file formatting with making <<workflow, changes>> - this can significantly complicate analysis down the road.

[[format-java]]
==== Java
Jave code formatting should be *Java Conventions*-compliant, with the following additional changes (Eclipse formatter settings shown below)

Use settings in  *Windows - Preferences - Java - Code style - Formatter*.
Open a standard formatter and save it under a different name after changing the following parameters:
[square]
* *Indentation - Tab policy* - *Spaces only*
* *Indentation* - *Tab size* - *4*
* *Line Wrapping* - *Maximum line width*  - *150*

*Window - Preferences - Java - Code style - Organize Imports* - put 99 and 1 in the respective fields.

Example/resulting Eclipse formatter file: link:../../.vscode/formatter.xml[formatter.xml]

[[ide]]
=== IDE
[[ide-eclipse]]
==== Eclipse
Currently one of the most handy platforms.
Download *Eclipse for Java EE Developers*, as this build already includes GIT client as well as JSP and XML editors.
Install the following plugins:
[square]
* *Buildship Gradle* - <<build, Gradle>> support;
* *AsciiDoctor* -  <<documentation, documentation>> editor;
* *MoreUnit* - convenient plugin to work with <<unit-test, unit-tests>>.

Right-click on the project and invoke *Refresh Gradle Project* menu item.
Also use it every time you change any of the project's libraries.

*Window - Preferences - General - Editors - Text Editors* - set a *Show whitespace characters* checkbox

*Window - Preferences - Team - Git - History* remove  *Relative history* checkbox

Import <<format-java, Java formatter>> via *Window - Preferences - Java - Codestyle - Formatter*.

[[ide-vscode]]
==== VS Code
A much faster than Eclipse, has better JavaScript and Gradle support.

Drawbacks:
[square]
* JSP support is nearly absent;
* external GIT client is required.

Install VS Code itself and the following extensions:
[square]
* *Java Extension Pack*
* *GitLens*
* *Git Graph*
* *Git History*
* *AsciiDoc*
* *Eclipse Keymap* - optionally

Visit link:../../.vscode/readme.txt[open] and navigate to `.vscode` catalog in project's DB_USER in order to get some configuration examples.
Java formatter and space symbols indicators have been already enabled there.

[[log4j]]
==== Logging
By default,  a running in IDE application uses <<kernel/extension.adoc#log4j, logging configuration>> from `src/log4j.properties`.
In order to adjust it, copy the file to the project DB_USER (will not be handled by GIT) and make required changes.

[[structure]]
=== File's structure
Project's folder listing along with description.
[square]
* *bin* - IDE-compiled Java classes;
* *build* - files related to <<build, build>>;
* *docpattern* - <<plugin/document/index.adoc#, Document>> plugin templates ;
* *dyn* - <<kernel/extension.adoc#dyn, dynamic code>>, with examples;
* *dyn.ext* - this folder can be used to mount dynamic classes on <<devm, developer's system>>;
* *filestorage* - file storage when launched from IDE;
* *lib* - Java libraries, which are not linked via <<java-lib, Gradle>>;
* *plugin* - <<plugin, plugin>> declarations;
* *src* - Java source code;
* *srcx* - <<documentation, documentation>>, <<unit-test, unit-tests>>, <<integration-test, integration tests>>, build utilities sources;
* *webapps* -  <<js-lib, Web application>> DB_USER;
* *work* - folder created by Tomcat for JSP file compilation.

=== Libraries
[[java-lib]]
==== Java
When link:../../build/bgerp/files/erp.sh[running] a program, a number of JAR files are linked from the following folders:
[square]
* *lib/app* - <<build-erp, application classes>>;
* *lib/ext* - external libraries;
* *lib/custom* - additional libraries required for <<kernel/extension.adoc#dyn, dynamic code>> and JEXL scripts.

External libraries are supplied with a separate <<build-update, build update>>.
Artifacts and versions are indicated in the following file: link:../../build.gradle[build.gradle] (for *bgerp* configuration)

IMPORTANT: This configuration does NOT use transitive dependencies  - all required libraries and versions have to be explicitly defined.
We would suggest to gradually add a small set of libraries until getting a "workable" application - this will allow to decrease build's size and simplify further support and troubleshooting.

In order to speed up project initialization, our default Eclipse IDE configuration does not load source code and documentation.
[snippet, from="ec", to="}"]
link:../../build.gradle#L18-L24[build.gradle]

[[js-lib]]
==== JS
JS libraries are located in the following folders:
[square]
* `webapps/js` - application's JS files: kernel's and <<plugin, plugins'>>;
* `webapps/lib` - external libraries.

Non-minified libraries are used in order to simplify debugging.

Some of the external libraries have been patched and all changes are accompanied by relevant comments, for example:
[snippet, from="con", to=");", remove-leading="		"]
link:../../webapps/lib/jquery-ui-1.12.1/jquery-ui.js#L8923-L8930[webapps/lib/jquery-ui-1.12.1/jquery-ui.js]

[[devm]]
=== Client's development methodology
BGERP launches within IDE, gets connected to the database and, optinally, billing.
At the end of the development/work session remote client database will have all the actual information, so it is only required to update the product itself.

[square]
* Use SSH to connect to the client, utilize port-forwarding in order to connect to the database and, optionally, billing.
Example: *ssh user@X.X.X.X -L3307:127.0.0.1:3306 -L8081:Y.Y.Y.Y:8080*
* Create your own *bgerp_customer.properties* file - you can use it to keep your configuration and access parameters. This file does not get pushed to GIT.
You can also use this file to alter billing connection URL - for example, to a localhost.
* Reconfigure BGERP port so you could save passwords in your browser for specific client(s).
* Create IDE launch configuration using this properties file
* Optionally, alter *.gitignore* in order to save custom client's files in case you are using fork.

[[workflow]]
== GIT Workflow
Table below describes GIT branches - link:https://docs.google.com/document/d/15NptRsx1qrdiWEew23EFz6gbxD6S12VQpnBQ6X9NbiQ/edit?usp=sharing[standard GIT Workflow] is used here.
Same workflow is used, for example, for Linux kernel development.

Main idea is that merging is only happening 'downstream', i.e. from the main branch to secondary branches, in order to get to the actual state.
Main branch has linear structure as all changes are incorporated via 'patches'.
Secondary branches can be then deleted, as all the aggregated information from secondary branches will be present in the main branch.

[cols="a,a,a,a", options="header"]
|===
|Branch
|Based On
|Purpose
|<<gitlab-ci, CI>>

|*master*
|
|Stable release.
|<<test-integration>>, <<publish-source>>

|*p<Process ID>-short-description*
|master
|Release and documentation changes.
|<<test-unit-and-doc>>

|*p11862-documentation*
|master
|Documentation changes. <<longlife-branch, Long-live branch>>, periodically gets incorporated into main.
|<<publish-doc>>

|*documentation-change-request*
|p11862-documentation
|Documentation changes proposals, can be merged back to p11862-documentation.
|<<test-unit-and-doc>>
|===

*master* is a main project branch and is used for <<build, builds>>.
[square]
* Each *change* should be based on the process within BGERP, which is used for all information exchange for a given *change*.
* *Change ID* is a *p<Process ID>* string, for example *p13455*
* For each change create a separate GIT branch (based on master). Branch's name should start from *Change ID*, then use "-" as delimiters.
Example: *p11788-link-filter-title*
* When developing, you can use any commit strategy within a branch: checkpoint commits, reverts/resets, commits to a new branch, etc.
We would recommend to push intermediate commits, using GIT repository as a backup copy.
* Main branch can be periodically merged to this "change" branch in order to synchronize with the actual state. *This HAS to be done before the 'merge --squash' to master*
* All the necessary  <<documentation, documentation>> changes are done simultaneously with the code changes
* Client's test build update and accompanying documentation can be <<build-update, built and published>> from the branch.
* Branch has to add *build/change.<Process ID>.txt* file - if absent, it gets added automatically during <<build-update, update build>>
This file has to describe new functions, fixes or other changes - each item on a separate row.
Format is identical to *changes.txt*, which accumulates all *build/change.<Process ID>.txt* information when <<build-erp, update>> gets published.
* Request branch *merge --squash* to master once client-side development and testing completes for a given change by moving BGERP process into *Acceptance* status.
* Process gets closed after check/acceptance, and change gets merged to master as a single commit with a comment starting with the change ID.
* "Change" branch can be then deleted. Change author can be later identified by the change ID used in the comment.


[IMPORTANT]
====
One cannot test and use in parallel several changes  within a single system.
Each change will overwrite the previous one when update gets installed.
In principle it is allowed to use multiple build branches, which are used as targets for multiple change branches' merges.
====

=== GIT Commands
Clean all links to non-existent/deleted branches:
[source]
----
git remote prune origin
----

Fetch master branch and update remote-tracking branch origin/master:
[source]
----
git fetch origin master:master
----

[[accept]]
=== Acceptance and merge --squash
When change is accepted, 'change' branch is compared with the master - so merge master to the 'change' branch before committing a change.

image::_res/branch_compare.png[]

[[change-file]]
It is also important to create and populate a file listing all changes.
You can use the following <<build, command>> for this:

[bash]
----
bash -c "./gradlew touchChanges"
----

GIT commands to be used for merging change from *pXXXXX-short-change-description* branch to master:
[source, bash]
----
git checkout pXXXXX-short-change-description && git pull
git commit --allow-empty -m "MERGED" && git push
git checkout master && git pull
git merge --squash pXXXXX-short-change-description
----

Commit with current GIT user.
[source, bash]
----
git commit -am "pXXXXX Some change description."
----

Or for preserving the author in GitHub. Mapping internal to external mails is available in file `.gitlab-ci-publish-author.sh`
[source, bash]
----
git commit -am "pXXXXX Some change description." --author="Developer Name <internal@gitlab.email>"
----

And finally, push.
[source, bash]
----
git push
----

<<build-erp, Update is published>> periodically from the main branch.

[[longlife-branch]]
=== Long-lived branches
Long-lived branches only get changes which *are not altering product functionality*, for example: localization and documentation fixes, code formatting, tests.
BGERP process for a change does not get closed , and <<accept, merge --squash>> is performed multiple times upon completion of specific change(s)

[[documentation]]
==== Documentation
A particular case of long-lived branch is documentation.
The source AsciiDoctor and resource files are placed in `srcx/doc` directory.
Publication of the product manual <<publish-doc, runs>> automcatically from <<workflow, branch>> *p11862-documentation*.

Documentation might be <<build-doc, built>> also locally from any branch and together with a <<build-update, change update package>>.

Documentation changes are recommended to be done at the end of <<workflow, branch development>>,
using <<change-file, change file>> as an intermediate notes. The samples of documentation's format may be found <<samples.adoc#, here>>.

Due the strict references and snippets checking, it is quite possible to have broken <<test-unit-and-doc, state>> of documentation
even without .adoc files. Something like the following:
[source]
----
2020-05-25 12:17:39,149 INFO DocGenerator [main] Processing: srcx/doc/project.adoc

----

For such cases here is the *fixing algorithm*.
First, find the failing line in `.adoc` file:

image::_res/snippet_fix_1.png[]

After that, using branch comparism, find the new rows and change them in the `.adoc`:

image::_res/snippet_fix_2.png[]

== Architecture
BGERP is a standalone Java application with a dynamic Web-interface.
When developing, you can <<run, launch>> BGERP directly from IDE

Figure below illustrates a request processing pipeline:

Request processing stages:
[arabic]
.	JS is used to form a request via HTML form , which is then sent to a Java Action class method.
.	Upon a change request system sends only a confirmation - JSON response with OK status
.	Any exception on Java Action side triggers a JSON with an ERROR status to be sent towards a client side.
.	Any successful data read request returns an HTML Fragment (Table with a list of usernames as an example), which can then be embedded into resulting HTML on the client side.

[[tech-stack]]
Below is a summary of a technology stack used, in descending order of importance:
[arabic]
. Java - all <<action, application logic>> is implemented as Java code, as Java provides best options in terms of easy of development, reliability and performance.
.. MySQL + JDBC - <<db, data>> processing.
. HTML + CSS - browser's markup language and style tables.
. JSP + JSTL - HTML page rendering templates,  <<jsp, presentation layer>>;
. JS + JQuery - client-side scripting language for dynamic content, only used as predefined framework calls.

IMPORTANT: Pay attention to avoid mixing the layers, e.g. creating application logic outside of Java code, defining presentation layer without JSP, performing data manipulation without MySQL.

[[db]]
==== Database
<<kernel/db.adoc#, DB Structure>> is documented in the common <<documentation, process>>, simultaneously with making changes.
Use `build/update/db.sql` script to create and <<kernel/install.adoc#update, update>> DB within application.
When <<run, launching within IDE>>, this script can be executed automatically upon each run.

In addition, plugins can have their own <<plugin-db, scripts>> run at the time of plugin initialization.


[[cache]]
===== Cache
Caching is used within internal Map and List in order to significantly (100s of times) expedite directory data retrieval when <<jsp, building UI>> or when running <<kernel/extension.adoc#jexl-process-context, JEXL scripts>>
Map allows to get specific value based on they kay (from a 'key-value' pair), list - an alphabetically sorted list.
Users, User Groups, Process types, configurations are examples of such cached data.

IMPORTANT: Use caches as much as possible for getting reference values and avoid querying DB extensively.

Directory data is edited directly in DB and cache is cleared after an edit.
[snippet, from="pu", to="}"]
link:../../src/ru/bgcrm/struts/action/admin/UserAction.java#L92-L98[ru.bgcrm.struts.action.admin.UserAction]

[[mvc]]
=== MVC
The project is using Apache Struts framework in a very own and customized way:
[square]
* requests are sent using <<sample-jsp-ui-ajax, AJAX>> and responses update HTML partially
* from Struts's JSP <<jsp-tag, tags>> <<sample-jsp-ui-restore-form, used>> only *<html:form* with *<html:param* inside
* <<action, action>> methods have different signature as standard
* the <<action-form, form>> object has always the same class

[[action]]
==== Java Action
Action classes are defined within `struts-config.xml` files and then are used within request's URL, where *action* HTTP request's parameter is used to indicate method's name.
If this HTTP parameter is not defined, then *unspecified* method gets invoked, however, this workflow is discouraged.

Action with forwarding definition example:
[snippet, from="<ac", to="on>", remove-leading="		"]
link:../../src/ru/bgerp/plugin/blow/struts-config.xml#L4-L8[src/ru/bgerp/plugin/blow/struts-config.xml]

Action has to extend javadoc:ru.bgcrm.struts.action.BaseAction[] class, its methods have to return by invoking *data* or *status*.
First method gets processed by JSP forward page and sends HTML back to the client. Second one is used to perform changes and only returns JSON-based change execution result.

[[action-form]]
====== Form Object
В каждый вызов акшена передаётся *супер объект form* javadoc:ru.bgcrm.struts.form.DynActionForm[], содержащий контекст выполнения:
Each action class method call gets a *form object*  javadoc:ru.bgcrm.struts.form.DynActionForm[] as a parameter. This object contains a context of request's execution;
[square]
* User;
* Request parameters and supplementary methods for parsing those parameters

CAUTION: Do not use a legacy action format with HttpClientRequest and HttpClientResponse parameters (note that they are still present in the form)

Below is a snippet of an ActionForward method:
[snippet, from="pu", to="}", remove-leading="    "]
link:../../src/ru/bgerp/plugin/blow/struts/action/BoardAction.java#L38-L58[ru.bgerp.plugin.blow.struts.action.BoardAction]

Result gets redirected to a JSP page:
link:../../webapps/WEB-INF/jspf/user/plugin/blow/board/show.jsp[webapps/WEB-INF/jspf/user/plugin/blow/board/show.jsp].

Use the same *form* to pass data for JSP rendering, excluding some auxiliary directories.
You can use form's *response* field for this.
When set to *responseType=json*, all data in the response gets serialized into JSON - that's why it is important to put directories into HttpResponse.

[snippet, from="pu", to="}", remove-leading="    "]
link:../../src/ru/bgcrm/plugin/dispatch/struts/action/DispatchAction.java#L46-L52[ru.bgcrm.plugin.dispatch.struts.action.DispatchAction]

[[action-name]]
===== Naming Convention
<<plugin, Plugin's>> action classes have to be placed into `PLUGIN_PACKAGE.action` package, class name should end with *Action*.
Previously Action classes have been located within `struts.action` packages - this approach is considered obsolete.

*User* <<kernel/interface.adoc#, interface>> actions are divided into /user and /admin
This separation will be used in future for distinguishing administrative calls.

*Usermob* и *open* interfaces have their own actions - in this case package names and URL have to contain *usermob* и *open*, respectively.
link:../../src/org/bgerp/action/usermob/ProcessAction.java[org.bgerp.action.usermob.ProcessAction] provides an example of such action.

We recommend to use the following naming convention for methods:
[arabic]
. [optional] Name of the object being handled in case a given class works with several objects.
. Verb which defines method's operation. For example, for CRUD these are: *list*, *get*, *update*, *delete*.


javadoc:ru.bgcrm.struts.action.admin.UserAction[] has some example method names:
[square]
* permsetList;
* permsetGet;
* permsetUpdate.

Another set of examples from javadoc:ru.bgcrm.struts.action.admin.AppAction[]:
[suare]
* status - provides application status;
* update - triggers update installation;
* userLoggedList - provides a list of logged in users.

It is recommended to use identical names for both method and forward:
[snippet, from="<action path=\"/admin", to="</action>", remove-leading="		"]
link:../../webapps/WEB-INF/struts-config.xml#L55-L58[webapps/WEB-INF/struts-config.xml]

[[action-permission]]
===== Permissions check
All action methods have to be defined within link:../../src/ru/bgcrm/model/user/action.xml[ru/bgcrm/model/user/action.xml] for the kernel or for the <<plugin, plugin>>.
The following link provides an example for Blow plugin's actions definition: link:../../src/ru/bgerp/plugin/blow/action.xml[ru/bgerp/plugin/blow/action.xml]
Actions from those files are forming a tree which is used for <<kernel/setup.adoc#user, access control>>.

Each action is identified by a class AND method, separated by semicolon.

Main identifier can be preceded by additional ones, also separated by a semicolon - for example, when renaming classes or methods.
This allows to provide backwards compatibility with permissions already present in the DB. New identifier will be used upon the next save operation of the permission set

[snippet, from="<item ti", to="с\"/>", remove-leading="		"]
link:../../src/ru/bgcrm/model/user/action.xml#L145-L146[ru/bgcrm/model/user/action.xml]

Additional/auxillary actions, which have to be permanently allowed, have to be marked with *allowAll="1"* attribute.

[[exception]]
===== Exception handling
Exception interrupts actions execution, also rolls back <<db, DB>> transaction - response will be always sent back as JSON.
All Exception handling is defined centrally in javadoc:ru.bgcrm.struts.action.BaseAction[], DAO methods or script handlers just need to raise a given exception.
Said that, action methods declarations and DAO just need to use *throws java.lang.Exception*.

javadoc:ru.bgcrm.model.BGException[] class is typically used for system-generated exceptions and is rarely used elsewhere.

javadoc:ru.bgcrm.model.BGMessageException[] which inherits from javadoc:ru.bgcrm.model.BGException[], is used to sent a <<l10n, localized>> message to the user,
without writing this message in the log.
For example:

[snippet, from="for (", to=");", remove-leading="            "]
link:../../src/ru/bgcrm/event/listener/ProcessClosingListener.java#L39-L41[ru.bgcrm.event.listener.ProcessClosingListener]

[[action-db]]
===== DB Operations
DB-related operations are performed via separate Java DAO (Data Access Objects) classes which are then used within actions.
Actions are using transactional request processing: transaction starts before method gets invoked, then a) gets committed (COMMIT) if there are no errors when returning results
or b) gets rolled back (ROLLBACK) if exception is thrown.

DB connection details have to be specified via action methods' *con* parameters. Some methods use *conSet* (javadoc:ru.bgcrm.util.sql.ConnectionSet[]) parameter, which invoke DB connection via a separate call.
The latter is more suitable for methods which do not demand a DB connection, or, on the contrary, for the ones demanding several connection types: to replica or "trash" DB for non-critical data (currently not supported)

Table names have to be specified via constants in order to improve code cohesion (see javadoc:ru.bgcrm.dao.Tables[] as example).
If a given table is only used in a single DAO class, then this constant has to be defined as private (javadoc:ru.bgcrm.plugin.fulltext.dao.SearchDAO[] as example)

Use link:https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.sql/java/sql/PreparedStatement.html[java.sql.PreparedStatement] class for building queries or. alternatively,
use its wrapper - ru.bgcrm.util.sql.PreparedDelay[]. The latter allows to 'glue' both queries and parameters and does not require to specify parameters' positions.

[[jsp]]
==== JSP View
HTML gets rendered on server-side using <<kernel/extension.adoc#jsp, JSP templates>> after receiving data from Action.
UI uses a set of unified components - thanks to that in most cases there is no need to install additional styles or create additional JS handlers.
<<sample-jsp-ui, JSP UI code>> examples.

[[jsp-request-params]]
===== SetRequestParamsFilter
The filter is executing after action and sets in request object Java objects, those methods may be called.
The following objects prefixes are available:
[[square]]
* *u.* javadoc:ru.bgcrm.util.Utils[]
* *tu.* javadoc:ru.bgcrm.util.TimeUtils[]
// duplicated in kernel/extension.adoc
* *su* link:https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-lang/javadocs/api-2.5/org/apache/commons/lang/StringUtils.html[org.apache.commons.lang.StringUtils]
* *сu* link:https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-collections/javadocs/api-3.2.2/org/apache/commons/collections/CollectionUtils.html[org.apache.commons.collections.CollectionUtils]

As an example see <<sample-date-format, date and time format>>.

Beside of the mentioned static functions, the filter sets also <<cache, caches>>.
All the request parameters are set in class link:../../src/ru/bgcrm/servlet/filter/SetRequestParamsFilter.java[ru.bgcrm.servlet.filter.SetRequestParamsFilter]

[[jsp-function]]
===== Functions
JSP functions are defined in the directory `webapps/WEB-INF/tld`.
Same as for tags IDEs support autocomplition for them.

IMPORTANT: Most of the functions there are deprecated because of possibility to <<jsp-request-params, call>> Java analogs.

Using semicolumn-separated JSP functions makes sence only for JSP specific things, like in the following cases.

[[jsp-function-uiid]]
====== Element IDs
HTML DOM model assumes all element IDs are globally defined using `class` and `id` attributes. Due to that it is quite tricky to track their usage and ensure their
uniqueness. Moreover, developer has to create a single-page application, which prevents to keep state for hidden elements.
In order to overcome this limitation, project attaches JS handlers via HTML onClick (and the like) attributes  using context variable 'this'.
Another method used for that is using `u:uiid()` function to generate a unique identifier, which is then used in auto-generated JS call.

[[jsp-tag]]
===== Tags
Components are defined within JSP tags and are declared in `webapps/WEB-INF/tags`
<<ide-eclipse, IDE Eclipse>> supports autocomplete when using them in the code.

image::_res/ide_jsp_tag.png[width='600px']

link:../../webapps/test.jsp[webapps/test.jsp] provides several examples of using JSP tags with user control elements.
Navigate to http://<host>:<port>/test.jsp in order to invoke template execution, alternatively visit a Demo server: https://demo.bgerp.org/test.jsp

For kernel, link:../../webapps/WEB-INF/jspf/user/menu.jsp[webapps/WEB-INF/jspf/user/menu.jsp] file defines menu items which are used to match URL and Java Action. For plugins this is done via <<plugin-xml-ui-menu, extension>> points.

[[jsp-tag-u-sc]]
====== u:sc
JSP page stores all variables  ones. Combined with includes and long templates, this can cause certain inconvenience.
`<u:sc>` context recovery tag is used to overcome this problem - all variables defined with this tag are cleared upon exit.

[[jsp-tag-p-check]]
====== p:check
The tag enables code inside it only when mentioned <<action, action>> is <<action-permission, allowed>> for the current user.
[snippet, from="<p:ch", to=">"]
link:../../webapps/WEB-INF/jspf/user/plugin/blow/board/show.jsp#L11-L14[webapps/WEB-INF/jspf/user/plugin/blow/board/show.jsp]

[[jsp-tags-top-line]]
====== shell:title and shell:state
Set the left area and the right areas of <<kernel/interface.adoc#user-top-line, top line>> in user interface.
<<l10n, Localization>> is supported using *ltext* attribute. Tag shell:state may create a documentation help link.
[snippet, from="<shell:t", to=">"]
link:../../webapps/WEB-INF/jspf/admin/config/list.jsp#L34-L35[webapps/WEB-INF/jspf/admin/config/list.jsp]

[[js]]
==== Java Script
JS is used to enabled dynamic content on the client side.
Scripts and associated libraries are located within <<js-lib, this path>>. <<plugin, plugins>> can have their own scripts.

In certain cases JS gets dynamically generated via JSP templates on a server-side.
This method is generally discouraged as it significantly complicates broweser-side debugging.

System functions are organized as object hierarchy built from the *+++$$+++* root object.
For example: link:../../webapps/js/kernel.ajax.js[+++$$+++.ajax], link:../../webapps/js/kernel.ui.js[$$.ui]
A typical scheme for attaching JS code to HTML is to setup event handler with a function call - <<sample-jsp-ui, AJAX example>>

Deprecated JS functions are marked using the following method:
[snippet, from="fun", to="}"]
link:../../webapps/js/kernel.ajax.js#L352-L357[webapps/js/kernel.ajax.js]

When such a function gets invoked, browser console gets a "clickable" "Deprecated" message which allows to find a this deprecated function call
It is forbidden to use those functions in the new code, usage has to be decreased in the existing code over time.

[[plugin]]
=== Plugins
Any logically detached functionality has to be moved into a plugin.
Isolation is a primary trait of a plugin. Each plugin works with a kernel and kernel has no knowledge of the inner works of a given plugin.
Plugins do not have to 'know' how other plugins work, either.
'Knowing' here means a necessity to rely on certain APIs or specific method calls.

[[plugin-class]]
==== Plugin's Java class
Application detects plugin upon start by a mandatory Java class, extended from javadoc:ru.bgcrm.plugin.Plugin[]
Class example; link:../../src/ru/bgerp/plugin/blow/Plugin.java[ru.bgerp.plugin.blow.Plugin]

Each plugin has a corresponding (and unique) Java *PLUGIN_PACKAGE* which includes this specific class.

Plugin class initialization method can also define event listeners:
[snippet, from="Eve", to="ss);", remove-leading="        "]
link:../../src/ru/bgcrm/plugin/slack/Plugin.java#L21-L23[ru.bgcrm.plugin.slack.Plugin]

In the particular case shown above, function handler gets included into <<kernel/extension.adoc#jexl, JEXL>> context.

Each plugin has to have a unique string identified which satisfies the following requirements:
[square]
* A single and unique for a plugin English word, all single case (no upper/lower mix) and without special symbols
* Plugin's <<db, DB tables>>, if present, have to start from this identifier.
* Plugin's <<action, actions>>, if present, have to start from /user/plugin/<identifier>.

[[plugin-db]]
If plugin uses <<db, DB>>, then plugin package can contain a script which creates or modifies tables.
As mentioned earlier, `db.sql script gets invoked during standard initialization routine.

Below is an example of a script for a FullText plugin
[snippet]
link:../../src/ru/bgcrm/plugin/fulltext/db.sql[src/ru/bgcrm/plugin/fulltext/db.sql]

[[plugin-xml]]
==== XML declaration
Optional `plugin.xml` file located within *PLUGIN_PACKAGE*

This file defines extension points:
[square]
* JSP templates;
* JS files.

[[plugin-xml-ui-menu]]
===== Menu items
Extension points definition within XML declaration:
[snippet, from="<en", to=">", remove-leading="	"]
link:../../src/ru/bgerp/plugin/blow/plugin.xml#L4-L4[blow/plugin.xml]

Example of adding a menu item using JSP tag: link:../../webapps/WEB-INF/jspf/user/plugin/blow/menu_items.jsp[webapps/WEB-INF/jspf/user/plugin/blow/menu_items.jsp]

[[plugin-xml-js]]
===== JavaScript
Extension points definition within XML declaration:
[snippet, from="<en", to=">", remove-leading="	"]
link:../../src/ru/bgerp/plugin/blow/plugin.xml#L5-L5[blow/plugin.xml]

File containing script: link:../../webapps/js/pl.blow.js[webapps/js/pl.blow.js]

[[plugin-action]]
==== Actions
Plugin <<action, actions>>, if used, have to be declared in *PLUGIN_PACKAGE.action* directory.
`struts-config.xml` and `action.xml` have to be located in *PLUGIN_PACKAGE*.

JSP templates - `webapps/WEB-INF/jspf/user|open|usermob/plugin/<identifier>`.

[[plugin-l10n]]
==== Localization
Plugin's <<l10n, localization>> file (`i10n.xml`) has to be located in *PLUGIN_PACKAGE*.
It is only used for localizing actions and action's JSP templates

[[custom-level]]
=== Customization
One of the main solution's prioritized features are extensibility and flexibility.
Said that, standard functions can be <<kernel/extension.adoc#tech-choice, extended>> by using several methods.

However, it is important to understand that the most effective way to efficiently develop and maintain functionality longer-term is to either use built-in plugin system or include as part of the kernel and at the same time
keep configurable parameters to a minimum.
JEXL scripts or dynamic code can be used for a quick prototyping or in order to implement certain application logic *which is extremely specific to a given installation*.

Our experience shows that all such customizations over time crystallize successful solutions suitable for a much larger group of users.
Such customizations have to be moved into a main code to make them part of the system and to then allow further community development and improvement.

The following diagram illustrates above-mentioned transformation dynamics for a code of different types. Size of a given rectangle correlates with a code size for a specific type.
Code size is a cumulative value for all Customers - larger size from scattered customizations gets translated into a much smaller universal code within a single *product*.

[[l10n]]
=== Localization
All log messages are produced in English only.

Localization gets applied to a user interface and messages addresses to a system user.
System language is defined globally within <<kernel/setup.adoc#config, configuration>>.

[[l10n-files]]
==== Files
XML localization file `l10n.xml` for the kernel is located in `src/ru/bgerp/l10n`,
for <<plugin-l10n, plugins>> - in their packages.
New localization phrases should be added to the end of the list in the file.

Custom localization may overwrite all of them and read out `custom/l10n.xml` file in case of existing that.

NOTE: To disable caching of localizations at the time of development, set in the configuration *localization.cache=0*

The key of the localizing phrase is the first entry in any language, for example Russian:
[source, xml]
----
<p><ru>Требуется повторная авторизация</ru><en>Re-authorization is required</en></p>
----

It is possible to use short abbreviated keys, representing them as records in a special system language, for example:
[source, xml]
----
<p><sys>reauth.message</sys><ru>Требуется повторная авторизация</ru><en>Re-authorization is required</en></p>
----

To change the labels on the buttons in the interface, add a separate localization (you cannot change the Russian localization, since it is used as a key), for example, change the button in the creation wizard, through the my language:
[source, xml]
----
<p><ru>Завершить</ru><en>Finish</en><my>Создать заявку</my></p>
----

[[l10n-code]]
==== Code
Localization can be done in JSP templates and Java actions. In JS code, localization is available only if it is generated by JSP.
In the JSP template code, the localization call from the example above looks like this:
[source, jsp]
----
$('#loginForm').dialog({
	modal: true,
	draggable: false,
	resizable: false,
	title: "${l.l('Требуется повторная авторизация')}",
	position: { my: "center top", at: "center top+100px", of: window }
});
----

By doing <<action>> in object *l* the localization context is passed, containing phrases for the core and the plugin being called.

[snippet, from="message.se", to="());", remove-leading="        "]
link:../../src/ru/bgcrm/struts/action/MessageAction.java#L235-L235[ru.bgcrm.struts.action.MessageAction]

Localized key string may contain placeholders for some values, marked as *%s*.
Such case may be seen for <<exception, BGMessageException sample>>.

[[l10n-dev]]
==== Development
All the new code has to be written using localized strings.
For legacy code recommended during other changes replace static strings to localized.

For figuring out missing keys add in <<log4j, logging configuration>>:
[source]
----
log4j.appender.l10n=org.apache.log4j.ConsoleAppender
log4j.appender.l10n.Target=System.out
log4j.appender.l10n.layout=org.apache.log4j.PatternLayout
log4j.appender.l10n.layout.ConversionPattern=%d{MM-dd/HH:mm:ss} %5p [%t] %c{1} - %m%n

log4j.logger.ru.bgerp.l10n.Localizer=DEBUG, l10n
log4j.additivity.ru.bgerp.l10n.Localizer=false
----

== Naming conventions
=== Configuration variables, JS functions, HTTP StyleId
[square]
* All plugin configuration variable names have to start with *<plugin>:*
* All plugin's JS function names have to start with *<plugin>-* prefix.
"-" cannot be used within a function name in other places.
* All DOM element identifiers (style id) for a plugin have to start with *<plugin>-*
"-" cannot be used within a DOM element identifier name in other places.

=== Database
1) Database and field names have to use underscore:
process_id
param_id

=== Java variables, HTTP request parameters, JSP variables
Have to use camelCase notation:
processId
paramId

=== Date - field entity
If a field has only date, then:
createDate - Java - java.util.Date type
create_date - DB - date type

If a field has date + time, then:
createTime - Java - java.util.Date type
create_dt - DB - datetime type

=== Date - period entity
If saving in bins, period has to use java.util.Date type with the following naming convention:
dateFrom
dateTo

Corresponding set and get methods:
setDateFrom
setDateTo
getDateFrom
getDateTo

CAUTION: Do not use Calendar bins!
Use TimeUtils to convert into Calendar or from Calendar.

For storing 'time', use:
timeFrom
timeTo

.. and also java.util.Date type.

Use Calendar for various calculators/billings when you need to constantly adjust dates.

Use from_date and to_date in the database ('date' type)

from_dt, to_dt - datetime type.

Infinity time/date - NULL.

[[samples]]
== Code samples
As system evolves and gets a lot of changes, this section contains referencing code examples.
Snippets below gets extracted from an actual project code, so these are always reliable.
Use IDE, if needed, in order to search for specific classes or files.

=== Saving latest/last user request parameters
Let's take interface filters, as example - use *restoreRequestParams* method in javadoc:ru.bgcrm.struts.action.BaseAction[]

Saving a value:
[snippet, from="resto", to=");", remove-leading=    "]
link:../../src/ru/bgcrm/struts/action/MessageAction.java#L90-L90[ru.bgcrm.struts.action.MessageAction]

Restoring a value:
[snippet, from="pu", to="}", remove-leading="    "]
link:../../src/ru/bgcrm/struts/action/MessageAction.java#L282-L294[ru.bgcrm.struts.action.MessageAction]

Saving and restoring a value at once:
[snippet, from="//", to=");", remove-leading="    "]
link:../../src/ru/bgcrm/struts/action/ProcessLinkAction.java#L53-L57[ru.bgcrm.struts.action.ProcessLinkAction]

=== Depicting element count on a tab.
For example, showing associated processes count. Gets saved on the first call.
Use javadoc:ru.bgcrm.model.IfaceState[] class

Refreshing value:
[snippet, from="// п", to="}", remove-leading="        "]
link:../../src/ru/bgcrm/struts/action/ProcessLinkAction.java#L221-L228[ru.bgcrm.struts.action.ProcessLinkAction]

Show in JSP:
[snippet, from="<c:if", to="if>", remove-leading="						"]
link:../../webapps/WEB-INF/jspf/user/process/process/process_editor.jsp#L81-L95[webapps/WEB-INF/jspf/user/process/process/process_editor.jsp]

[[sample-date-format]]
=== Date and time format
When formatting date and time values in Java or JSP , use the following formats in order to keep unified approach and maintain independence from the current locale:
[square]
* *ymd* - year, month, date;
* *ymdh* - year, month, day, hour;
* *ymdhm* - year, month, day, hour, minute;
* *ymdhms* - year, month, day, hour, minute, second.

Java code uses javadoc:ru.bgcrm.util.TimeUtils[] class for date formatting, this class also contains format constants.

The same functions may be used in <<jsp, JSP>> using `tu` prefix:
[snippet, from="<input type=", to="d}\"/>", remove-leading="				"]
link:../../webapps/WEB-INF/jspf/user/parameter/edit.jsp#L158-L158[webapps/WEB-INF/jspf/user/parameter/edit.jsp]

=== Configuration Java Beans
In order to speed up parsing and validation, use Java class objects inherited from javadoc:ru.bgcrm.util.Config[]
For example: link:../../src/ru/bgcrm/model/config/IsolationConfig.java[ru.bgcrm.model.config.IsolationConfig].
This configuration supports constructor with a validation flag, which allows to check syntax when saving.

Configuration bin can be also obtained in JSP:
[snippet, from="<c:", to="/>"]
link:../../webapps/WEB-INF/jspf/user/plugin/task/task_list.jsp#L4-L4[webapps/WEB-INF/jspf/user/plugin/task/task_list.jsp]

[[sample-logging]]
=== Logging
==== Java
javadoc:ru.bgerp.util.Log[] logger class is used, which is based on <<kernel/extension.adoc#log4j, Log4j>> framework.
When launching from IDE, you can copy link:../../build/bgerp/files/log4j.properties[build/bgerp/files/log4j.properties] file from distribution kit into project's root folder and adapt, as needed.

Use `log` protected variable when logging within <<action, actions>>

Create *static final* class variable within Java classes:
[snippet, from="pub", to=");"]
link:../../src/ru/bgcrm/worker/MessageExchange.java#L16-L19[ru.bgcrm.worker.MessageExchange]

Exception message output:
[snippet, from="try", to="}", remove-leading="					"]
link:../../src/ru/bgcrm/worker/MessageExchange.java#L60-L64[ru.bgcrm.worker.MessageExchange]

==== JS
Show debug data instead of console.log:
[snippet, from="con", to="}"]
link:../../webapps/js/kernel.shell.js#L5-L12[webapps/js/kernel.shell.js]

Enabling debug:
[snippet, from="$$.", to="0,"]
link:../../webapps/js/kernel.js#L18-L22[webapps/js/kernel.js]

=== Pagination
Putting results into JSP and rendering a form;
[snippet, from="<c:", to="rm>", remove-leading="		"]
link:../../webapps/WEB-INF/jspf/user/process/process/link_process_list.jsp#L75-L83[webapps/WEB-INF/jspf/user/process/process/link_process_list.jsp]

Java action:
[snippet, from="//", to="open);", remove-leading="        "]
link:../../src/ru/bgcrm/struts/action/ProcessLinkAction.java#L212-L214[ru.bgcrm.struts.action.ProcessLinkAction]

[[sample-jsp-ui]]
=== JSP UI
A simple dictionary with pagination, AJAX editor invocation: link:../../webapps/WEB-INF/jspf/admin/process/status/list.jsp[webapps/WEB-INF/jspf/admin/process/status/list.jsp]

[[sample-jsp-ui-ajax]]
Sending AJAX for sending, exiting or restoring data in <<kernel/process/index.adoc#type, process type properties editor>>:
[snippet, from="<div", to="/div>"]
link:../../webapps/WEB-INF/jspf/admin/process/type/properties.jsp#L191-L196[webapps/WEB-INF/jspf/admin/process/type/properties.jsp]

Recursive include:
[snippet, from="<c:", to="if>", remove-leading="					"]
link:../../webapps/WEB-INF/jspf/admin/user/check_tree_item.jsp#L48-L50[webapps/WEB-INF/jspf/admin/user/check_tree_item.jsp]

Action execution result include:
[snippet, from="<c:", to="/>", remove-leading="			"]
link:../../webapps/WEB-INF/jspf/admin/user/user/update.jsp#L161-L166[webapps/WEB-INF/jspf/admin/user/user/update.jsp]

Flex layout, using constants from Java classes, print button close to a field:
[snippet, from="<div", to="/div>", remove-leading="				"]
link:../../webapps/WEB-INF/jspf/user/search/search.jsp#L77-L96[webapps/WEB-INF/jspf/user/search/search.jsp]

Snap-in refresh upon moving back to it:
[snippet, from="<script", to="/script>"]
link:../../webapps/WEB-INF/jspf/user/log/log.jsp#L22-L28[webapps/WEB-INF/jspf/user/log/log.jsp]

Sending AJAX request and blocking a button during a long(er) action execution:
[snippet, from="<bu", to="on>"]
link:../../webapps/WEB-INF/jspf/admin/dynamic/dynamic.jsp#L22-L30[webapps/WEB-INF/jspf/admin/dynamic/dynamic.jsp]

[[sample-jsp-ui-restore-form]]
Restore form parameter values:
[snippet, from="<ht", to="/>"]
link:../../webapps/WEB-INF/jspf/admin/directory/parameter/group/update.jsp#L8-L10[webapps/WEB-INF/jspf/admin/directory/parameter/group/update.jsp]

[[build]]
== Build and publish
Project is configured in Gradle format (configuration file: link:../../build.gradle[build.gradle])

For building and publishing, apart from Java you will need <<env-console, console environment>> with available *ant*, *ssh* and *rsync* packages.

NOTE: Here and below all commands are shown for WSL environment, *NIX will not need `bash -c` prefix.

[[build-doc]]
=== Documentation
[source]
----
bash -c "./gradlew clean buildDoc"
----
Resulting HTML files will be present in *target/doc*. Internal link validation is performed automatically.

[[build-update]]
=== Change update
Build and publish on https://bgerp.org/update update package with a <<workflow, change>>.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Public SSH key or the developer might be added for *bgerp-cdn@pzdc.de*.
Before you publish a change update, make sure that `ssh bgerp-cdn@pzdc.de` sessions work for you.
====

Clean before publish:
[source, bash]
----
bash -c "./gradlew clean buildClean "
----

If there are some <<documentation, documentation>> or <<java-lib, Java libraries>> changes:
[source, bash]
----
bash -c "./gradlew buildUpdateLib buildDoc"
----

Or only application changes:
[source, bash]
----
bash -c "./gradlew buildUpdate"
----

For publish operation make the command:
[source, bash]
----
bash -c "./gradlew publishUpdate"
----

Of course, all the Gradle tasks might be started together, so the typical case is:
[source, bash]
----
bash -c "./gradlew clean buildClean buildUpdate buildDoc publishUpdate"
----

All the updates packages are copies to Web directory: `https://bgerp.org/update/PROCESS_ID`
The <<change-file, change file>> has also copied, and all documentation links there starting from `https://bgerp.org/doc`
are automatically replaced to the `https://bgerp.org/update/PROCESS_ID/doc`.

Users have a capability to <<kernel/install.adoc#installer, install>> a package using *install* command,  report issues and caveats and, 
if new version is not operational/suitable, rollback to the latest published version using *update* command.

Multiple update publications are possible until all bugs/caveats are found - after that that change <<workflow, gets merged (with --squash)>> 
into a main branch and a new build gets <<build-erp, published>>

[[build-erp]]
=== Release
CAUTION: Check <<unit-test, Unit tests>> running.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Public SSH key or the developer might be added for *bgerp-cdn@pzdc.de* and *www@bgerp.org*.
Before you publish a change update, make sure that `ssh bgerp-cdn@pzdc.de` and `ssh www@bgerp.org` sessions work for you.
====

Build is performed from a *master* branch and can include several <<workflow, merges (with --squash)>>.

IMPORTANT: Perform a separate GIT Push for each 'merge --squash' in order to correctly <<publish-source, publish>> in the open repository.

Depending on the presence of <<java-lib, 3d-party libraries>> in an update, perform the following:
[source, bash]
----
bash -c "./gradlew buildClean buildUpdate"
----
or:
[source, bash]
----
bash -c "./gradlew buildClean buildUpdateLib buildUpdate"
----

Then:
[source, bash]
----
bash -c "./gradlew patchChanges rss publishBuild publishCommit"
----

Check the release commit and make:
[source, bash]
----
git push
----

Merge the latest state of the master on <<documentation, documentation>> branch.

[[build-docker]]
==== Docker Image
[source]
----
docker login --username bgerp
----
Input access token.

Go in directory `build/docker`
[source]
----
bash files.sh &&
docker build . -t bgerp/bgerp &&
docker push bgerp/bgerp
----

[[test]]
== Tests

[[unit-test]]
=== Unit
JUnit framework is used (`srcx/test' directory)
Used to test specific algorithms, test do not depend on each other and do not work with DB.

Test are launched locally using the following command:
[source, bash]
----
bash -c "./gradlew clean test"
----

[[integration-test]]
=== Integration
TestNG framework is used (`srcx/itest' directory)

Integration test performs initialization an empty DB and filling after it with configuration.
Tests form a dependencies graph which defined order and execution parallelism.
Upon successful tests execution, written in DB dump <<test-integration, gets extracted>> for https://demo.bgerp.org

[source, bash]
----
./gradlew integrationTest -Pdb.host=DB_HOST -Pdb.user=DB_USER -Pdb.pswd=DB_PSWD
----

Parameters *DB_HOST*, *DB_USER*, *DB_PSWD* are used for accessing the MySQL server, where a test DB will be created.
Use <<run-data, Docker DB Instance>> for the that.

[[integration-test-opt]]
==== Optimization
Addtionally to the recommended MySQL <<kernel/install.adoc#mysql, configuration>>, check and set in `my.ini`:
[source]
----
innodb_file_per_table=0
----

That will significantly increase table creation speed.
After the first successful run, the structure of a DB will remain persistent and re-created faster by this way.

Creation of dump for Windows:
[source, bash]
----
echo DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS bgerp; > ./dump.sql &&
echo CREATE DATABASE bgerp DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci; >> ./dump.sql &&
echo USE bgerp; >> ./dump.sql &&
mysqldump -uDB_USER -pDB_PSWD bgerp --add-drop-database --no-data >> ./dump.sql &&
type build\bgerp\db_init_end.sql >> ./dump.sql
----

For *NIX:
[source, bash]
----
echo "DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS bgerp;" > ./dump.sql &&
echo "CREATE DATABASE bgerp DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci;" >> ./dump.sql &&
echo "USE bgerp;" >> ./dump.sql &&
mysqldump -uDB_USER -pDB_PSWD bgerp --add-drop-database --no-data >> ./dump.sql &&
cat build/bgerp/db_init_end.sql >> ./dump.sql
----

Running the tests after:
[source, bash]
----
mysql -uDB_USER -pDB_PSWD < ./dump.sql &&
gradlew integrationTest -Pdb.user=DB_USER -Pdb.pswd=DB_PSWD -Pskip.dbReset=true
----

[[gitlab-ci]]
== GitLab CI
link:../../.gitlab-ci.yml[.gitlab-ci.yml] file has configuration for runnign certain tasks automatically upon each GIT commit.
Different tasks are executed within different <<workflow, Workflow>> branches.
Please find below description of CI tasks

[[test-unit-and-doc]]
=== test-unit-and-doc
Launches <<unit-test, Unit tests>> and  <<build-doc, documentation build and validity check>.

[[test-integration]]
=== test-integration
Runs <<integration-test, integration test>>.

[[publish-doc]]
=== publish-doc
Launches <<build-doc, documentation build and validity check>>, if no errors are found, publishes on https://bgerp.org/doc/3.0/manual.

[[publish-source]]
=== publish-source
Publishes actual source code from `master`into an open repository https://github.com/pingvin235/bgerp
This method has been chosen in order to limit an open repository size and in order to hide previously deleted files from history.

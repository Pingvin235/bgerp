== Migration

To reduce downtime during migration you may install MariaDB as Docker container so both MariaDB and MySQL work simultaneously.
For this you need:
[square]
* Install link:https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/[Docker]
* Run script _mysql_migrate.sh_ which does all work of database migration for you

Then, after successfully migrating to this MariaDB in Docker you may link:https://mariadb.com/kb/en/binary-packages/[install] MariaDB on host instead MySQL and migrate to it.

To view the MariaDB-in-container logs:
[source, sh]

To view the container status:
